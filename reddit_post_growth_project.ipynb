    "For this article, your problem statement will be: _What characteristics of a post on Reddit contribute most to the overall interaction (as measured by number of comments)?_\n",
    "\n",
    "Your method for acquiring the data will be scraping the 'hot' threads as listed on the [Reddit homepage](https://www.reddit.com/). You'll acquire _AT LEAST FOUR_ pieces of information about each thread:\n",
    "1. The title of the thread\n",
    "2. The subreddit that the thread corresponds to\n",
    "3. The length of time it has been up on Reddit\n",
    "4. The number of comments on the thread\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've got the data, you will build a classification model that, using Natural Language Processing and any other relevant features, predicts whether or not a given Reddit post will have above or below the _median_ number of comments.\n",

    "**BONUS PROBLEMS**\n",
    "1. If creating a logistic regression, GridSearch Ridge and Lasso for this model and report the best hyperparameter values.\n",
    "1. Scrape the actual text of the threads using Selenium (you'll learn about this in Webscraping II).\n",
